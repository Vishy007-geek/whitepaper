# What is Legacy Code Re-factoring?
{: .text-purple}

Dining at a fancy restaurant, you want to spend some quality time, enjoying tasty food and drinks. When choosing the latter, chances are you will prefer a glass of good wine, the older the better. For that matter, we all know old wine and old friends are the best. The problem is, unlike wine and friends, software doesn’t get better with age.
Think of code refactoring as keeping a clean, orderly house. When you have a clean and well-organized home, you’re less stressed because everything is just easier to find and operate. On the other hand, a home with unnecessary clutter can lead to a chaotic and stressful environment.
Code refactoring presupposes restructuring and optimizing existing code without changing its external behavior. Refactoring an application component allows for solving technology problems and improving the component’s features and structure.
